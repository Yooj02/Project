<H3> WEEK 10 | FINAL PROJECT</h3>
<p> 
In this week, I made a Table for my final project. Designing my final project was not a easy thing. After I consider for few days, I chose to make a "California" concept table. Firstly, I started with the woodwork. I need to make 4 table leg, so I used a electronic saw to cut the wood. Electronic saw was dangerous, so I had to focus 100%. After I cut all my woods, I glue them so the leg can be more thick. After I finished the woodwork, I designed my board, that will be placed on top of my table. I put the logo of three teams from LA, Dodgers, Lakers and Rams. Than I laser cutted the board to finish. Furthermore, I printed out the Disneyland logo, Santa Monica beach logo sticker to put on the leg of my table. Finally, I glued the leg to my board and finish the project. I sepnt around 4 hours to finish my project, woodwork takes a lot of time, because I need to glue the board and leg again and again to stick them.Also, my hardest part was woodworking, because I never used electronic saw.  It is a really dangerous machine, so I had to focus fully to not injured myself. I used designing from coreldraw, Laser cutting, Sticker printing, and woodworking as my four process. From this project, I learned that combine a four process in one project is really hard, and each process take longer time than I thought.
