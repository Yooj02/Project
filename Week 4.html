<H3> Week 4 | Laser cutting</h3>
<p> 
In this week, we did the Laser Cutting to make our own clock. Firstly, My design concept was Avengers. So I put Thor,Hawkeye and Iron Man on my design, change the picture to hairline, and put the file on usb. 
	After that, I went to Laser printer to print my clock, and set up the printer with Mr.Gerber. 
	Finally I waited infront of the laser printer untill the printing ended(to watch any fire), than I put the battery on my clock and finished.
Secondly, I laser engraved a bookmark for the second project. My design concept was two big amusment park in Korea, Everland and Carribean bay. After the design I go through the similar process, put my file on USB, set up the printer, and waited for 15 minutes to finish my printing,	
Finally, I designed a Glass, using a new logo of Seoul.I go thorugh the similat process, put a picture in Coreldraw, and printed on the glass using a Laser cut printer.
