<H3> Week 3 |Printers</h3>
<p> 
In this week, I made a T-shirt, Pencil case and Popsocket with the Garment printer, Sublimination printing and UV printer. Firstly, I printed a T-shirt with Garment printer.
	We need to design a shirt with a Ohio,Hudson or Western reserve concept, so I chose a Ohio concept and print the spelling of Ohio on the printer. After I designed my T-shirt on corel draw, put the file on USB and heat up the printer. 
	After I wait  1~2 minutes, I click the "Print Data load" to print my T-shirt, and finish my T-shirt printing.
Secondly, I printed the pencil case from ublimination printing. I designed my pencilcase based on the Template that given by Mr.Gerber, my design concept was Korea national soccer team logo. 
	I put my coreldraw file to USB and pressured the pencil case 60s, 400 degrees to print my design on the pencil case.
Finally, I printed the popsocket from a UV printer. My design concept was a Manchester United logo, I put my file on USB and put the popsocket insider printer. 
	And I press the setup button to control the panel, then I finally bring my file from computer and put on Queue A to print.
