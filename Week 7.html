<H3> Week 7 | Skate board</h3>
<p> 
In this week, we made a skaeboard and design it. Firstly, we start with woodwork. I worked with Brian to stick the wood piece together with woodglue, it was a really hard job. The woodglue dried in few minutes, so we had to work hard for glue 4 pieces of wood. After we finished the glue, we used the machines in WIC, to made skateboard as a best shape. The machines were really dangerous, I focused 100% to not get injured. Finally, we designed the skateboard. I chose the sticker printing, and printed the Santa Monica beach logo + bomb logo, to show thw pirate+beach concept. I think this project was the hardest project, because we need to combine designing and woodworking, put 100% effort to glue the wood and not get injured by the machines.
