<H3> Week 5 | 3D printing</h3>
<p> 
In this week, we learned how to do the 3d printing, and focused on print our face by the 3d printers.
Firstly, I scanned my face with Brian, and put the scanned file on my computer to edit. Furthermore, I added the tower under my face. Just pring my face was to normal, so I try to find some 3d obect that I can add on under my face. Than I find a tower from a 3d print website, I added on my file.
Then I put my file on USB to print on MakerBot 3d printer, and setup the printer with Mr.Gerber and print my face along with tower. As we use more and more 3d printers these days, having a chance to use 3d printing is a great oppertunity for me. Designing was quite hard, but it was worth to do after I saw my face on 3d printing.
