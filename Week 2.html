<H3> Week 2 | Fusion 360</h3>
<p> 
In this week, we used fusion 360 to create various 3d images. Our assignment was to create 3d object, I made different type of 3d shapes with the Fusion 360. Fusion 360 is a program that create a 3d object that we want, and maybe print the 3d object in 3d printer. I never used fusion 360 before, so making a 3d object was not a easy process for me. However, after a few try I knew that I have to click a sketch and line button, to draw a square in 2d space. Than I need to click Create - Extrude to make it as a 3d object. If you need to cut, you can do it after you extrude your object.
