<H3> Week 6 | Vinyl cutting</h3>
<p> 
In this week, We used Roland Printer to print our own stickers. Firstly, my design concept was a logo of South Korea's independence movement day. After I chose my design, I chosed the detailed logo from corel draw, and  I ungroup all object, chose a outline colur to finish the design. Than I save my file as a EPS file, put it on USB and bring it to the Roland printer to print. My biggest challenge during this week was set up the sticker printing in the coreldraw. There are so many dteps that I need to follow, so I ask to Ms.Fritz so many times for help.
